//! Unique owned pointer types for objects with custom drop logic.

//! These pointer types are useful for C-allocated objects which by API-contract
//! are owned by Rust, but need to be freed through the C API.

/// Types that specify their own way of performing allocation and destruction. Typically, this trait
/// is implemented on types from the C side.
///
/// Implementing this trait allows types to be referenced via the [`Owned<Self>`] pointer type. This
/// is useful when it is desirable to tie the lifetime of the reference to an owned object, rather
/// than pass around a bare reference. [`Ownable`] types can define custom drop logic that is
/// executed when the owned reference [`Owned<Self>`] pointing to the object is dropped.
///
/// Note: The underlying object is not required to provide internal reference counting, because it
/// represents a unique, owned reference. If reference counting (on the Rust side) is required,
/// [`AlwaysRefCounted`](crate::sync::aref::AlwaysRefCounted) should be implemented.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A minimal example implementation of [`Ownable`] and its usage with [`Owned`] looks like
/// this:
